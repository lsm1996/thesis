%% Talk about weighing up the use cases against each other. {Like if the functionality of the phone was reduced, what use cases would be removed} -- Ask Paul about this. You could also talk about why and how you came up with some of the use cases. Additionally, you could display each use case to one or more functional requirements in a table with a weighting to them.
\section{Use Cases}
%% Eg. Use case 3.1.2
%% Lisa demonstrates that the MEGA65, as a message sending and recieving device, should not require the user to connect it to an electrical outlet for it to be useful. Hence, from this use case we can derive the need for the MEGA65 to have an on board battery to enable it to be used anywhere. In order to further save on power when not in use, the MEGA65 should have sleep and wake functionality. This functionality doubles as the MEGA65 should not require constant user supervision and therefore should be able to be left and resumed instantaneously.


%% Talk about how the functional requirements turned into hardware requirements. Like how did the highly secure communcation, not nesserssarily one time pad communication, turn into turning the modem on and off in hardware? If you could link this to something in your literature review that would be even better.
