\section{Results \& Discussion}

	After completing the project it was found that the main goals of discovering the functional and hardware requirements to design a secure phone device was accomplished. The components required to design such a device were found with adequate reasoning as to why they were chosen, with their schematic and PCB footprint designs created in Altium. The following paragraphs summate the findings found throughout the project.\\

	At the beginning of the project research questions were devised to help guide the development of the project. The following paragraphs describe the research questions and detail the results of following the research questions and whether or not they have been accomplished.\\

\begin{enumerate}
\item What power control circuitry can satisfy the security-driven requirement of the MEGA65 to be able to power down all communications hardware when required, yet remain able to be woken by that same hardware?\\

	This major research question was solved through the schematic design of the power control circuitry. This involved researching a method for the power control to work, with various components requiring different current needs. This also involved searching for a suitable component, with a number of suitable components found and compared to find the optimal component. The goal to be able to design the circuit so that all communications could be powered down and powered up by the same hardware was completed, without the PCB fully completed. This also involved testing the required components to see that the powering down was occurring.
	
\item What trade-offs, if any, are required to satisfy the functional and dimensional requirements of the MEGA65 phone PCB?
\end{enumerate}

	Due to the PCB still being developed, and the initial revisions of the device to be quite large, there have been no trade-offs due to the functional or dimensional requirements of the PCB. Trade-offs may be considered however when the board reaches further revisions due to the dimensions of the PCB already being quite small for all the required components.
