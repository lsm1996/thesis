	After completing the project it was found that the research questions had been answered to the point that the functional and hardware requirements had been defined and the power control circuitry had been completed. This project involved a lot of research in finding suitable components that work well with other components in the device in terms of the current and voltages being produced. Planning was also vital during the project, with a lot of the signal connections and how all the components were to be connected together thought out in the beginning stage of the project. The project's schematics were produced along with the correct component PCB footprints and a template design for the PCB was also produced. It was found that the main routing stage of the PCB was highly complex especially with the aims of having a six-layered board. \\
	Further research in the project could be made in designing the PCB board, and researching better, more suitable components for the required tasks.
