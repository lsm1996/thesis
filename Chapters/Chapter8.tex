	Upon completion of the project it was quite apparent that the research questions had been answered. 
An evaluation of the completed works showed that the functional and hardware requirements had been defined and the power control circuitry had been completed. During this project extensive research was required in order to find components that seamlessly integrated with existing hardware of the device. 
Some considerations when selecting a potential component included the current and voltage that the component operated at. 
In addition to component research, well evaluated plans were vital during the project. 
These plans allowed the wide range of components to be connected and interconnected clearly and concisely during the initial design stages of the project. 
Over the course of the project three major deliverables were produced, they include, the various schematics of the phone's subsystems, the PCB footprints for the components used in the phone and a template PCB design. 
During the attempts to route the template PCB, it was discovered that the aim of designing a six layered PCB was non-trivial.\\
	In the consequent works to this document, a high priority should be placed on improving the template PCB through improved board layout, more suited component selection and template PCB routing. \\

	After completion of the project it was clear that the main goals had been accomplished, as the functional and hardware design requirements to create a secure phone had indeed been discerned. 
The components required to design such a device were identified and, with adequate reasoning, evaluated as to why they were chosen. 
These components then had their schematic and PCB footprint designs created in Altium. 
The following paragraphs summate the findings found throughout the project.\\
