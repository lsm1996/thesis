This section describes the hardware requirements based upon the list of functional requirements derived in the previous chapter.

\section{Hardware Requirements}

The following lists summarise the functional requirements for the device. That is, the functions that are crucial for the completion of the project.
These have been group according to three major subsystems: (1) power management; (2) switches and connectors; and (3) on-board modules and peripheral devices.
Power management includes the circuitry that allows the FPGA to be switched off when the phone is in standby, and yet be woken when required, e.g., on an incoming phone call or time of day alarm.  Switches and connectors are simply that, the components that provide physical connection to the outside world, while the on board modules and peripheral devices covers the remaining components.

Schematics for the hardware that provides the functionality for each requirement are found in Chapter \ref{Chapter5}.

\item Disabling the power supply to 4G LTE Modem.
\item Disabling the power supply to FPGA and dependent components via GPIO line of FPGA.
\item Enabling the 3.3V power supply to FPGA and dependent components by employing momentary switch.
\item Enabling the 3.3V power supply to FPGA and dependent components by an interrupt signal from the 4G modem (also see \autoref{chap:modem}).
\item Enabling the 3.3V power supply to FPGA and dependent components by an alarm signal from a Real-Time Clock (also see \autoref{chap:RTC}).
\item Microphone input from headphone and internal microphone can be physically disabled with a switch.

\item Power Indication LED for 4G LTE module.
\item Power Indication LED for FPGA board.
\item Power Indication LED for WiFi board.
