Notes on network complexity, including "The more complex the network, the more likely a security rule can be bypassed" http://conferences.sigcomm.org/co-next/2009/workshops/rearch/papers/Behringer.pdf
there are estimators of proccesor design complexity, e.g., https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1540961, however they are tailored for use by the designers, not external examiners.
