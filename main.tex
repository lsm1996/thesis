%	ABSTRACT PAGE

\begin{abstract}
  \addchaptertocentry{\abstractname} % Add the abstract to the table of contents
  The security of modern smart-phones and computers is impossible to guarantee or to assume due to the out-of-control complexity of
  these devices.  The MEGA65 project seeks to address this by creating simple computing and communications devices that remain
  sufficiently useful in practice. The MEGA65 phone is designed around an open and simple architecture that are simple
  enough to allow highly secure operation.  This requires the ability to isolate, and when necessary de-energise, untrustable
  components like the cellular modem.  This thesis documents the process of developing a schematic and initial printed circuit board
  layout for the MEGA65 phone.  This included elucidation of the functional requirements, selection of hardware components and
  architectural elements that can support those functional requirements, as well development of the circuits to implement each, the
  incorporation of those circuits into a complete schematic design, and the transformation of that schematic design into a printed
  circuit board layout that can be manufactured to form the core of fully functional prototypes of the MEGA65 phone.
  This is made possible in part by targeting a hand-held game-console form-factor, to avoid the need to for extreme miniaturisation,
  which significantly reduces the design effort and cost of manufacturing prototype devices.  Low-cost iteration of the design is
  supported by using a removeable FPGA module, so that the circuit board can be refined without the cost and complexity of purchasing
  and attaching a large BGA part to the main circuit board.  The result is a circuit board that is sufficiently affordable and
  manufacturable to support the future stages of the MEGA65 phone project, without compromising on satisfaction of the functional
  requirements.
